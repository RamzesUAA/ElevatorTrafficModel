# ElevatorTrafficModel
Create a simulation model of elevators in high-rise buildings. The user must be able to specify the number of floors in the building, the types of elevators and their number. The building can randomly generate future passengers with a given weight and with the intention to go to one or another floor. Passengers can line up in the elevators on the principle of the most even distribution in the queues. When loading the elevator, the total weight that can be transported is taken into account. In case of elevator overload, its movement will not be allowed. If the elevator is not fully loaded, it can serve a call on one of the intermediate floors of its path. Elevator calls are grouped into queues with priorities. The program should graphically display the proposed model.
